      businessProblem="Managing a growing fleet of employee workstations, laptops, and mobile devices creates significant internal overhead. Internal teams get bogged down manual setups, inconsistent software versions, missing security updates, and device troubleshooting. When devices fail or lack proper baseline configurations, employee productivity drops and security risks increase. Organizations need reliable device lifecycle management without heavy administrative friction."
